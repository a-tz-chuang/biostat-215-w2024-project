# Biostatistics M215: Final Project

## Libraries: 
```{r}
#Relevant libraries:
library(survival)
library(PAmeasures)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(pec)
data_directory <- "functions/"
source(paste0(data_directory, "pam.survreg.update.R"))
```

## Dataset:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
